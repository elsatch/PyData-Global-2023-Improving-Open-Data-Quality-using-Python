# Improving Open Data Quality using Python

This repo has the complete materials of the tutorial session Improving Open Data Quality using Python, presented at PyData Global 2023 conference

## Preparing the environment

First, we should create a python virtual environment and install the required dependencies. To do so, we can run the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv data-quality
```

Now depending on your OS, you should run the following command:

- Linux/MacOS

```bash
source data-quality/bin/activate
```

- Windows

```PowerShell
data-quality\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Finally, we can install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the environment in Google Colab

You can also launch the notebook in Google Colab performing the following steps:

1. Open the Colab web site: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. File menu -> Open notebook
3. Click on the GitHub tab
4. Paste the following URL: https://github.com/elsatch/yData-Global-2023-Improving-Open-Data-Quality-using-Python.git
5. Select the `single_datasets.ipynb` notebook
6. Execute the specific cell for colab at the beginning of the notebook
